# MiCADO

This is the organisation for the dynamic cloud orchestrator MiCADO.

This software was developed as part of the now completed [COLA project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/731574).
The University of Westminster (U.K.) and MTA SZTAKI (Hungary) will
continue its open-source development as part of other research projects.

MiCADO is an auto-scaling framework for Docker applications. It supports autoscaling at two levels. At virtual machine (VM) level, a built-in Kubernetes cluster is dynamically extended or reduced by adding/removing Nodes hosted on cloud virtual machines. At container level, the number of replicas implementing a Docker Service is automatically increased/decreased. The application detailing the services, links and scaling rules must be specified by a TOSCA-based Application Description Template (ADT).

The MiCADO manual is hosted at https://micado-scale.readthedocs.io .
